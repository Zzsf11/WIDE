## Data prepation
We introduce WIDE (RailWay surveillance vIdeo anomaly DEtection dataset), the first large and diverse dataset specifically designed for anomaly detection in railway surveillance. WIDE provides: (i) high-resolution video frames from 1080p to 2160p, (ii) synthetic anomalies generated using a physics engine to ensure realistic motion, and (iii) diverse environments featuring various lighting conditions.
